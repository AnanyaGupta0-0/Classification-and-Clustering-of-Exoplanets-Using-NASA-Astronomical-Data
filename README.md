# Classification and Clustering of Exoplanets Using NASA Astronomical Data

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project focused on
classification and clustering of exoplanets using NASA astronomical datasets.

## Project Status
🚧 Work in progress  
The complete source code, notebooks, datasets, and results will be pushed shortly.

## Project Overview
- Supervised learning for exoplanet classification
- Unsupervised learning (clustering) for pattern discovery
- Data sourced from NASA Exoplanet Archive

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
